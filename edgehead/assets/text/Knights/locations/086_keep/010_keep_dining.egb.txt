ROOM: $keep_dining

FLAGS: $IDLE

POS: 9, 81

MAP_NAME: Dining Room
HINT: The place where the Lord of the Keep dined with his family. A place with a good view of the redwoods outside.

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Dining Room
FIRST_HINT: I can see a female figure silhouetted against a tall window. She is not moving, but I can feel she's alive, or at the very least undead. She waits.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
[[IF c.knows(LadyHopeFacts.ladyHopeName)]]Lady Hope faces me and prepares for battle.[[ELSE]]An undead woman faces me and prepares for battle. Later, I find out her name is Lady Hope.[[ENDIF]] I wonder if sheâ€™s seen my brother.

[[RULESET]]
[[RULE]]
  // Variant for players who kill Darg first, Lady Hope second.
  c.hasHappened(evKilledDarg)
[[THEN]]
  As I approach, a forced, unnatural smile distorts the undead face. I am reminded of my fight with Darg. The necromancer is speaking through dead flesh again.
[[ENDRULE]]

[[RULE]]
  $DEFAULT
[[THEN]]
  As I approach, a forced, unnatural smile distorts the undead face. I am duly impressed. Someone must be puppeteering the body. A highly skilled necromancer, perhaps.

  I risk a quick look around the room. Nobody else is here. The necromancer must be doing this from afar. Even more impressive.

  But then, Lady Hope's undead lips start moving. She _speaks._

  "Welcome, young one." The voice is dry and labored, but nevertheless understandable. A talking corpse is something I've never even considered before. This is obviously necromancy of some higher level.
[[ENDRULE]]
[[ENDRULESET]]

"You made it rather far, I admit." The body starts walking toward me. "But now you die."

[[CODE]]
if (c.hasItem(familyPortraitId)) {
    s.add('As she approaches, Lady Hope seems taken aback by the portrait I have with me. This gives me initiative. ', isRaw: true);

    w.updateActorById(
        ladyHopeId,
        (b) => b
          ..initiative = 0
          ..dexterity = b.dexterity! ~/ 2);

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateLadyHopeFight

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
Lady Hope is defeated, but her head is still talking.

"I see you, young friend," the head says. "I see your ambition. I see your talents. I see your brutality, which I like most of all."

A barren approximation of a laugh leaves the throat.

"Too many young people limit themselves," the head continues. "They limit their effect on the world. You don't. But I warn you: you're not to cross me. You're not to ascend to the top. If you do, you die. You are not Doghead. It is not your fate to save this place. And that means, if you cross me, your fate is to die."

And then, as if to illustrate the point, Lady Hope's face goes to rigor mortis, her features suddenly aging and wrinkling, and she talks no more.
