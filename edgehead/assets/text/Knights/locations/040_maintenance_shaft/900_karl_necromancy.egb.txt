// Keep this in sync with RaiseDead.helpMessage.
HINT: Raising the dead will make them fight for me. I do not know in advance which corpse will rise. I cannot do this if I am already followed by an undead. My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I perform necromancy. I feel I have awakened something human-sized but not entirely human. Then, a terrible roar and thrashing comes from beyond the gate.

// Keep in sync with FightSituation's RaiseDead.applySuccess.

"What's going on?" the berserker asks, picking up his battle axe. "What's going on with Karl?"

The two approach the large gate and open it to peek inside. Almost instantly, a giant hand pushes the door open so hard that it launches the berserker across the room. Hitting the wall snaps the beserkerâ€™s neck, and he does not move anymore.

From my perspective above the room, it is hard to see the creature beyond the gate. But it is clearly a giant, and it is clearly out of its mind with pain. The guttural roar is deafening, and blood is filling the floor beneath its feet.

The orc captain starts backing up from the gate but the giant creature lunges forward and smashes the orc with the back of its hand. There isn't even time for a scream. The captain is dead instantly.

The creature does not stop. It takes a few steps forward, holding its belly with one hand. Then it trips, twists, and falls on its back. I can see the stomach, running with blood. Something is puncturing it from inside.

I realize it is the undead I just raised. A bird-headed creature, a hawkman, is cutting its way out of the giant's belly with its beak. The undead's movements are mechanical, imprecise, but the beak is sharp enough. The giant is losing blood quickly.

When the hawkman's head is finally out, the guttural roar gets louder. Using the last of its strength, the giant puts its hand on the hawkman, then yanks. The bird head rolls on the floor, dead again.

Soon after, the giant stops moving.

I wish I could raise this new corpse, but it is well beyond my capability.

FAILURE_BEGINNING_DESCRIPTION:
// Keep in sync with FightSituation's RaiseDead.applyFailure.
I try to perform the necromantic incantation but I fail. [[IF a.sanity < 1]]My sanity is already gone.[[ENDIF]][[IF isFollowedByUndeadActor(c, a) || isFollowedByUndeadInsect(c)]]My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds, and I already have an undead follower.[[ENDIF]] Nothing happens.

It is a shame. I feel an interesting, freshly dead body somewhere nearby.
