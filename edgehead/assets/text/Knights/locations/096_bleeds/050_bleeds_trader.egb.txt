FIRST_MAP_NAME: Trader's Shop
FIRST_HINT: A mossy, stone building without a porch. The sign "Trader" is written above a window in simple graffiti letters.

MAP_NAME: Trader's Shop
HINT: The shop of the local trader and his son, Leroy. Sells basic items for the inhabitants of the Bleeds and for the farmers of the Pyramid.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
[We] enter a small building made of stone. It's dark in here but cozy.
A gray-haired trader greets me and gestures around.

"Everything is for sale. And for a good price, too."

I don't really have any money, so I just nod and smile.

DESCRIPTION:
The trader {nods|pretends to smile} as [we] enter his shop.

INK:
The trader shrugs.

"It's terrible. Everyone is afraid, nobody buys anything. Well, except for travel gear. But we're out of that until the next caravan." He glides his hand over the counter to suggest that there is nothing left.

* "Afraid of what?"

  "Orcs, goblins, kobolds, you name it," he says. "And I get it, [young sir]. I get it. San Francisco is getting more dangerous every day. But is it _so_ dangerous we all have to leave? <>

* "Why travel gear?"
  
  "People are leaving. <>

-

<> Even _he_ wants to leave."

This is the first time I notice a person sitting in one corner of the room, quietly {polishing a strip of leather|sewing two strips of leather together|pinching holes into a strip of leather}. The man introduces himself as Leroy. He is the trader's son.

"Well why wouldn't I leave, father? We all should. What awaits us here? It's just... it's just..."

The trader shakes his head and interjects, "What awaits us anywhere else?"

"... death or slavery." Leroy deems his point made, ignoring his father's interjection. He goes back to his work.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The trader bangs on the wooden counter, immediately angry. "Goblins! The suckers are getting cockier and cockier. Among all the problems we have, they're the worst. I fear we won't get a caravan anytime soon because of them. No caravan means no goods. No goods mean no trade."

Leroy smiles wryly. "No trade means no money."

His father looks at him, annoyed. "No money means no food."

Leroy looks as if he wants to add something, but thinks better of it.

The trader, obviously satisfied, turns back to me. "The suckers are closing in from all sides. A few months ago they wouldn't dare approach the Pyramid. But lately, they come much closer."

"I could see the smoke from one of their camps a while back." Leroy talks to his leather strip.

"What smoke?" the trader says.

"There's a camp to the west," Leroy says. "Less than a mile from here."

"There's a goblin camp _less_ _than_ _a_ _mile_ from the Bleeds? How do I not know this?"

Leroy seems genuinely surprised. "I thought you knew. Everyone knows."

"It's to the west. It doesn't seem like there are a lot of goblins there. We thought the Knights would get rid of them for sure."

"But the Knights are leaving," says the trader. He looks at me for reaction and when he doesn't get any, he turns back to his son. "The Knights are leaving," he repeats.

[[CODE]]
c.learn(KnightsFacts.knightsAreLeaving);
[[ENDCODE]]

"Well," says Leroy, "if we aren't leaving this place like they are, it looks like we'll have to learn how to live here, without the Knights. We could take up the fight ourselves."

The trader groans. "Don't be stupid, Leroy."

"I mean it! [[IF c.playerIsMale]]Sir[[ELSE]]Lady[[ENDIF]], you seem to be an adventurous soul. If you ever want my help, just ask." Leroy points to a chest near where he sits. "I have a long dagger and a decent shield, and I can use both."

"The hell you can! You're a trader, Leroy! You're no fighter." Leroy's father is shaking. When he remembers that I'm there with them, he apologizes, then turns back to Leroy. "Son, I forget that you are a grown man now. But... it is my wish that you don't go."

NOTES:
// Optional: Put the trader vs son conflict into context.
//       Trader talk is to the point. You can even buy stuff.
//       You can talk to Leroy without even talking to his father.


I enter the shop. It's less of a hut than most buildings in this place, but still pretty basic. Light streams through a single window to the left. When my eyes adjust, I see an old man behind a narrow counter, and a young man next to the window. The young man is polishing boots, checking his work in the stream of light.

"Welcome," says the old man with a big tired smile.

The young man scoffs. He nods at me, then returns to his work.
