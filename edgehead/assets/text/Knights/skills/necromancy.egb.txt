COMMAND: Skills >> Necromancy

// Keep this in sync with RaiseDead.helpMessage.
HINT: Raising the dead will make them fight for me. I do not know in advance which corpse will rise. I cannot do this if I am already followed by an undead. My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds.

PREREQUISITES:
!c.getRoomRoaming().monstersAlive
&&
!c.playerRoom.isSynthetic
&&
c.playerRoom.isOnMap

!storyNecromancyHasPrecedence(c)

REPEATABLE: $TRUE

FAILURE_BEGINNING_DESCRIPTION:

[[IF a.sanity < 1]]My sanity is already gone.[[ENDIF]][[IF isFollowedByUndeadActor(c, a) || isFollowedByUndeadInsect(c)]]My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds, and I already have an undead follower.[[ENDIF]] Nothing happens.
